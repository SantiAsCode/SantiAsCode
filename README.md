## Public Projects

I still have more private projects than public, but I can't wait to contribute to the community and be part of open-source projects.

### reto-tecnico

The test stated that I had to build an app with microservices architecture where it represents a restaurant that opens for free one day and prepares dishes randomly between 6 recipes. Development concluded.

Project created in Laravel 10, PHP 8.2, Laravel Octane with Swoole for 2 microservices and Apache for the one which contains the front-end, Livewire and Tailwind to create that front-end easily, models and migrations with the corresponding database tables to the challenge (ingredients, market transactions, requests for food dishes and recipes), 3 controllers (each corresponding to the microservice that corresponds to it), supervisor to maintain the server's DAEMON and a Laravel Queue Worker in an image of Docker,

Configuration files, scripts in Bash and specific dockerfiles for each of the dockerized images.

Features:
- 3 Docker Images for each microservice
- Front-End built with Livewire components (can be improved by replacing polling with another data-retrieving process)
- DB migrations
- Configuration and deployment described in the README

### terminal-portfolio

Intended to be my portfolio app deployed in an AWS EC2 instance to be accessible publicly. Ongoing development 😅, need more time to finish it.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to reach out for collaboration or just a friendly chat.
